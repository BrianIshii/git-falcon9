# git-falcon9
This is a plugin for the [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) terminal that launches a Falcon 9 when you push code and lands when you pull code with Git.
Inspired by [gitrocket](https://github.com/bomanimc/gitrocket), [space-pull](https://github.com/lukaszromerowicz/space-pull) and [SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing CSS](https://codepen.io/simoberny/pen/PEJxPQ)
